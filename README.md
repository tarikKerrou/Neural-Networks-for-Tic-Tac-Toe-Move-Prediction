# Neural-Networks-for-Tic-Tac-Toe-Move-Prediction
This project explores the use of multi-layer neural networks for predicting the optimal move in the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.The approach involves training the neural network on a set of examples and using it to predict the move that is most likely to lead to a win. The project also includes the development of a Tic-Tac-Toe game application where a huma
