# Neural-Networks-for-Tic-Tac-Toe-Move-Prediction
This project focuses on using multi-layer neural networks to predict the best move in the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The neural network is trained on a set of examples, which consist of board states and the corresponding optimal moves. The network learns to identify patterns in the board states that lead to winning moves and uses this knowledge to predict the optimal move for a given board state.

The project includes the development of an application that allows a human player to play against the machine. The machine's move is determined by the neural network's prediction, which is based on the current state of the game board. The application also includes a user-friendly interface that allows the player to easily make their moves and view the current state of the game.

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of neural networks for predicting moves in strategic games and provides a practical example of how this technology can be applied in a real-world context.
